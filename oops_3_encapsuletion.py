'''bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single
unit (class).¬ç
True or False?

You can use a private attribute within the class method.true

It refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods 
(functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, 
known as a class, and restricting access to some of the object's 
components.
This helps in hiding the internal state of the object and only 
exposing a controlled interface.


Benefits of Encapsulation
Controlled Access: Encapsulation allows you to control how the data is
 accessed and modified. For example, you can validate data before updating it.
Increased Flexibility: By hiding the internal implementation details, you can 
change the internal workings of a class without affecting code that uses the class.

Improved Maintenance: Encapsulation helps in organizing code better, making it 
easier to understand and maintain.
Enhanced Security: By restricting access to internal data, encapsulation helps
 protect the integrity of the data and prevents unintended interference.


Accessing a private attribute directly from outside its class is generally discouraged in Python. However, Python 
employs name mangling for private attributes, which means you can access them using a specific naming convention from 
outside the class if necessary. 
#accesing using name mangling
print(my_car._Car__odometer)
Methods of objects we've looked at so far are called by an instance of a class. However, there are other types methods that 
a class can have - class and static methods.
